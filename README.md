A loan consists of the following properties:

- Loan ID

- Borrower name

- Repayment amount

- Funding amount (the amount given to the borrower which is less than the repayment amount)

 

Task 1: Web API

Create a C# Web API (.NET or .NET Core) that has methods for doing the following:

- Adding a loan

- Getting a loan by loan ID

- Getting all loans

- Deleting a loan

 

The loans should be added to an in-memory data store in the Web API application. This means the data will only exist whilst the API is running.

 

Task 2: Website

Create a website with one page that allows you to call all methods of the Web API.

 

Optional bonus points:

- Make the website look nice.

- Use Angular/React/Vue.

- Use .NET Core.

- Use one or more design patterns.

- Add tests

 

Submission

- Put the Web API in a folder called "Web API" and the website in a folder called "Website", then put both folders in a zip file.

- Make sure not to send any binaries from the C# project i.e. clean the solution first.

- Include instructions of how to run the website.

- Send the zip file to mark.ufland@youlend.com

- Try and complete it in a week.
